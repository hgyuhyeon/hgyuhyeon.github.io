        <div class="title">About me</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Hello! I am 4th-grade student backend developer specializing in Python/Django development.<br>
            <br>
            My interest in web development began in the class where I had to submit a web project in 2021. Since I was the only
            backend developer of the project, I managed all about the backend part, such as designing, implementing, and maintaining
            it. The experience of managing the structure and API of the backend server was new. It also gave me a sense of
            accomplishment, "I made something!"<br>
            <br>
            I like new things. I am interested in web backend and have participated in various projects in a backend position. From
            the beginning, I didn't follow the rules of RESTful API and utilize web frameworks. However, as I participated in the
            other projects, I applied elements one by one that I couldn't do in the last one. In my first project, I didn't know
            that the framework have existed. But I got RESTful API rules, actively leveraged the Django framework, and introduced
            Docker to increase the efficiency of the deployment environment configuration in my most recent internship project.<br>
            <br>
            I have fast adaptability. In the summer of 2021, my first internship, the tools I used at work were unfamiliar to me. I
            learned a little about JavaScript and PHP in school classes, but I've never seen a framework called Gnuboard used by the
            company. However, I even like new tools too! I understood this framework for the first day and actively participated in
            service maintenance of the company from the next day. <br>
            <br>
            I'm used to collaboration. As I participated in internships and projects, I definitely separated my role
            from my teammates. In addition to implementing the back-end API, I was in charge of managing and giving
            feedback on the team members' work, and finishing the project. This process was done using GitHub, Notion,
            and Slack. So I'm used to developing with many people.<br>
            <br>
            Plus, My nickname is Kyu(Q). Since my name is hard to pronunciate, I frequently have trouble when friends want to
            call me and even when I order some foods with my name. I told my friends about this problem, and one friend suggested
            using "Kyu" instead because one letter of my name sounds like "Kyu" which is actually "Gyu" After I accepted his
            suggestion, I ordered a beverage and requested to call me "Kyu" But the cashier wrote my name "Q" However, I like this
            too! Therefore, you can call me whatever you want but among "Gyuhyeon", "Kyu" or "Q"<br>
            <br>
            I like music and musical instruments! I enjoyed watching concerts and orchestra performances, and when I was
            a high school student, I worked as a member of the school orchestra. I live with music. I use my free time
            learning English, Japanese, and figure skating and enjoy them steadily as well as enjoying music.
