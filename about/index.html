        <div class="title">About me</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Hello! I am junior software developer specializing in Django/Python server development.<br>
            <br>
            My interest in server-side development began in the class where I had to submit a web project in 2021. Since I was the only
            server developer of the project, I managed all about the server part, such as designing, implementing, and maintaining
            server and API. The experience of managing the structure and API of the server was new. It also gave me a sense of
            accomplishment, "I made something!"<br>
            <br>
            I like new things. I have participated in various projects in a server developer position. Even though 
            I couldn't follow the rules of RESTful API and utilize web frameworks in the beginning, however, as I participated in the
            other projects, I applied elements one by one that I couldn't do in the previous projects. In my first project, I didn't know
            that the framework exists. As I proceed more projects, I got RESTful API rules, actively have used the Django framework, and have applied
            Docker to increase the efficiency of the deployment environment configuration.<br>
            <br>
            I have fast adaptability. In the summer of 2021, my first internship, the tools I used at work were unfamiliar to me. I
            learned a little about JavaScript and PHP in school classes, but I've never seen a framework called Gnuboard used by the
            company. However, I even like new tools too! I understood this framework for the first day and actively participated in
            service maintenance of the company from the next day. <br>
            <br>
            I'm used to collaborate with others. As I participated in internships and projects, I definitely separated my role
            from my teammates. In addition to implementing the API, I was in charge of managing and giving
            feedback on the team members' work, and finishing the project. This process was done using GitHub, Notion,
            and Slack. So I'm used to developing with many people.
